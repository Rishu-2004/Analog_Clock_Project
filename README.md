# Analog_Clock_Project
The Analog Clock Project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional, web-based analog clock. HTML provides the structure for the clock face and hands. CSS styles the clock, including positioning and rotating the hands. JavaScript updates the clock hands every second based on the current time.
